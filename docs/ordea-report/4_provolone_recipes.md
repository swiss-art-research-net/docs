Compact description of what this documentation does.

What are the main entities involved in a DR pipeline? 

-  a pipeline is made of distinct [**steps**](#pipeline-step), where the output of one step often serves as output to the following one;
- a pipeline is typically built in the context of a specific [**project**](#project), but the models and software it relies on may be reused within several pipelines across different projects;
- a pipeline uses, consumes, and produces [**digital objects**](#digital-object) (e.g., data, machine learning models, scripts, Jupyter notebooks).

For each of these entities, we define a *model*, consisting of semantic fields, and we provide examples (in the form of JSON and Turtle) of how these models and their fields should be mapped into semantic statements (RDF).

Finally, in the section [**URI templates**](#uri-templates) we describe how to construct URIs for specific entity types.

### *Project* model

**Description**: A project is the context within which a digital reading pipeline is created and implemented. (See [model documentation on Zellij](https://zellij.takin.delving.io/docs/display/appcQruLQ0OWFHWlX/Models?search=ANTM.15_Project)).

**Fields:**

 - *Name*: The name of the project (LAF.6)
 - *Actor*: A person or institution participating to he project (SRDF.129)
 - *Actor role*: The role played by a given person or institution in the project (SRDF.130)
 - *Description*: A description of the project (LAF.15)
 - *URL*: The URL of an online resource providing further information about the project (SRDF.369)

 **Example**

 > The BSO image classification pipeline was created by Florian Kräutli (knowledge graph engineer) in the context of the Bilder der Schweiz Online project,

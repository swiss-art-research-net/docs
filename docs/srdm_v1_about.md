!!! note "Nota bene"

    The Reference Data Models and Ontological Modelling Patterns  (Version 1, as of 2019) have been updated to an extended and more comprehensive Version 2. We encourage you to use the new version 2 as it provides enhanced scope and compatibility with other modelling frameworks (e.g. Linked.Art v1, as of 1/2025).

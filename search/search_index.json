To summarize, semantic reference data projects provide a series of templates or recipes of how to approach different data modelling scenarios using extant ontologies. The units of documentation are:</p> <ul> <li>Project: a defined area of documentation / data capture which would benefit from standardization and information integration and is the target of a semantic data modelling exercise (e.g.: general art history, data provenance, architectural competition history etc.).</li> <li>Model: a distinct real world entity that is the subject of documentation and about which we are interested in its connections to other real world entity / models within the scope of the project (e.g.: artwork, person). A model is made up of fields and collections of fields.</li> <li>Collection: a distinct repeatable data pattern collected relative to entities, not as an object of documentation in itself but as a set of data points typically considered together and a subject for standardisation of approach (e.g.: name information, description data, identifier information, citation data etc.). A collection is made up of fields.</li> <li>Field: a unique and identifiable data point which is given a name, identifier, human readable description and a defined semantic path in the scope of an ontology. This serves as the ultimate building block for collections and models.</li> </ul> <p>Users of this site can explore a growing collection of semantic reference data modelling projects that SARI has developed and maintains. Especially:</p> <ul> <li>SRDM v.1: This project represents the initial effort in the area of semantic reference data modelling by SARI. It offers a set of semantic data patterns for the modelling of art and architectural history at a general level. Built primarily off of CIDOC CRM and FRBRoo with some additional extensions, it offers a set of recipes of how to model common entities in the art historical domain like artworks and built works using these standards. This version is now closed and maintained for historic reference.</li> <li>SRDM v.2: This project represents an update to the SRDM v.1 modelling. This project continues the basic effort and coverage of SRDM v.1 but aimed to carry out two major improvements. On the one hand, it sought to align modelling patterns with the Linked.Art data modelling project which has overlapping interests in art history and also adopts CIDOC CRM as its overall ontological framework. The goal here was to align as closely as possible on obviously similar and non controversial topics, for example: names. At the same time, SRDM v.2 aimed to make use of the innovations provided by the Art and Architectural Argumentation Ontology (AAAo) in the representation of elements of art history not well covered by CIDOC CRM, viz. the social context of art historical facts.</li> <li>PROVOLONE: The PROVenance Ontology for Linked Open pipeliNEs, described as part of the ORDEA report, is a series of semantic recipes to describe digital provenance in data-intensive pipelines, such as machine learning pipelines for computer vision. The ontological foundations of the PROVOLONE recipes lie in CIDOC CRM, CRMdig and AAAo.  </li> </ul> <p>This site will evolve and be enriched as further projects are carried out and documented and existing projects are enriched with examples and illustrations.</p> <p>Towards that end, in this site, you will find documentation of different semantic data modelling projects that aim to serve as guides and / or recipes for creating well modelled and documented semantic data.</p>"},{"location":"instruction/","title":"Instruction","text":""},{"location":"instruction/#formalisation-and-instructions","title":"Formalisation and instructions","text":"<p>Each information category is represented here both in the form of a table and in the form of a semantic graph model.

Summary","text":"<p>A report on the computer vision landscape: models, pipelines, data formats and provenance</p> <p>Matteo Romanello , Florian Kr\u00e4utli , George Bruseker , Thomas H\u00e4nsli </p> <p>Info</p> <p>This report was produced in the context of work-package D of the project ORDEA (Open Research Data Environments for the Arts), financed by Swissuniversities. For further information on the project and on other research outputs produced see the project website.</p> <p>Computer vision (CV) plays a pivotal role in the digital transformation of the GLAM sector, as the acquisition of any document, whether visual or textual, necessarily involves an intermediate image format. The application of CV technologies to GLAM materials reveals considerable potential for both research and the transformation of archival practices, especially by aiding curators in the creation and enrichment of descriptive metadata for cultural heritage documents. At the same time, CV models have evolved rapidly over the last decade, with the emergence of multimodal and foundation models, thus creating new research opportunities in image-heavy domains such as history of art and history of architecture. Moreover, while semantic standards such as CIDOC-CRM are becoming widely adopted by GLAM institutions for describing their collections, their usage for modelling data and annotations produced by CV models remains limited.</p> <p>In light of this situation, the objective of the present survey within the framework of the ORDEA project is two-fold. Firstly, it will constitute the basis for a user-oriented workshop aimed at exploring use cases for the usage of surveyed CV models in the context of art history and architecture history research. Secondly, it will inform the creation of a set of \"semantic recipes\" for the modelling of provenance in data resulting from CV pipelines.   </p> <p>This survey is organised into three main sections. Section 1 (Tasks, pipelines and applications) provides an overview of existing CV tasks (e.g., object detection, image similarity, etc.) that are most relevant for GLAM data, and showcases selected examples of existing CV pipelines that integrate multiple tasks to produce innovative user-facing applications (examples include GallicaPix, ArtVision, Bilder der Schweiz Online, etc.). Section 2 (CV Models) surveys existing computer vision models, focusing specifically on their application with GLAM data in a research setting. Particular emphasis is placed on the latest advancements in the domain, including multimodal models and the emergence of pre-trained foundational models for computer vision. Lastly, Section 3 (Semantic modelling of provenance and annotations) reviews the current approaches to the semantic modelling of digital provenance and discusses the primary affordances of the most widely used CV formats in terms of data representation.</p>"},{"location":"schema/","title":"Extension","text":""},{"location":"schema/#swiss-art-research-infrastructure-cidoc-crm-extension","title":"Swiss Art Research Infrastructure CIDOC-CRM Extension","text":"<p>IRI :   http://w3id.org/sari</p> <p>Current version :   1.0</p> <p>Imported ontologies :   CIDOC-CRM: http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/</p> <p>Authors :   George Bruseker (Foundation for Research &amp;     Technology), Nicola     Carboni (University of     Zurich)</p> <p>This work is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.</p>"},{"location":"schema/#abstract_1","title":"Abstract","text":"<p>This document, automatically generated from the official access point, presents an extension of CIDOC-CRM develop within the Swiss Art Research Infrastructure (SARI) project to support propositions about persons and their social relations.</p> <p>Namespace: The namespace for SARI terms is http://w3id.org/sari</p> <p>Prefix: The suggested prefix for SARI is sari</p> <p>RDFS: an RDFS version of the ontology is available on this link</p>"},{"location":"schema/#abstract","title":"Table of Content","text":"<ul> <li>Introduction</li> <li>Graphical Overview</li> <li>Classes<ul> <li>SRPC3 in social relation</li> </ul> </li> <li>Properties<ul> <li>SRP1 used language (was language used by)</li> <li>SRP2 had occupation (was occupation of)</li> <li>SRP3.1 relation type (relation type)</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"schema/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>This document presents an extension of CIDOC-CRM.

The artwork is taken here in the sense of a movable, physical work of some sort such as would be typically inventoried by a museum. Specific documentation of elements of an artwork depends highly upon the kind of artwork it is. This reference model does not intend to cover such specificities but to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high-level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for an artwork and to provide for these, in turn, a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: </p> <ol> <li> <p>to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams</p> </li> <li> <p>to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data</p> </li> <li> <p>to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns</p> </li> <li> <p>to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"et/artwork/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<p>The decision on which fields to represent was based on a survey of significant, extant data sources of interest to the project.

The scope of this reference model is the bibliographic item as information object and pointer to real world instances of the publication; this model aims to provide a streamlined list of common descriptors for a bibliographic item and not a complete representation of all aspects of a real bibliographic record. Rather, we are interested here in representing the types of information that are typically gathered by scholars relative to a publication in their creation of bibliographies for use in scholarship and used as the basis for citations. This reference model aims to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for a bibliographic item as such and to provide for these in turn a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This level of modelling is seen as a necessary basic reference point on which to build more complex documentation. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: </p> <ol> <li> <p>to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams</p> </li> <li> <p>to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data</p> </li> <li> <p>to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns</p> </li> <li> <p>to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"et/bibliographic_item/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<p>In formulating this reference model, we have made reference to some well known bibliographic standards, but in practice found it most useful to refer to commonly used bibliography generation tools such as Zotero to identify required fields. </p> Acronym Source Name Official Access Point Schema Documentation Maintained by MARC 21 Marc 21 - Bibliography Heading Fields http://www.loc.gov/marc/ http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/ Library of Congress CiTO CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology nan https://sparontologies.github.io/cito/current/cito.html David Shotton Silvio Peroni BIBO Bibliographic-Ontology-BIBO http://bibliontology.com/ https://github.com/structureddynamics/Bibliographic-Ontology-BIBO/blob/master/bibo.owl Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Giasson - Structured Dynamics BIBFRAME nan http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe-category.html nan Library of Congress ISBD International Standard Bibliographic Description https://www.ifla.org/best-practice-for-national-bibliographic-agencies-in-a-digital-age/node/8912 https://www.ifla.org/files/assets/cataloguing/isbd/isbd-cons_20110321.pdf IFLA"},{"location":"et/bibliographic_item/#model-sections-description","title":"Model Sections Description","text":"<p>The fields used to describe a bibliographic item can be functionally grouped according to higher level units in order to allow for an easier approach to the entry and navigation of the data by information category.

Built work is taken here in the sense of a - typically - immovable building, or significant individual part thereof, made for some human use-function such as habitation. The fuller documentation of a built work would establish the relation of the physical work to the series of intellectual and social processes related to the production of such works, such as architectural plans, meetings, construction episodes, detailed use and modification history, specific topological relations and so on. This reference model does not intend to cover such specificities but to remain at a more general level, providing a consolidated, high-level reference data model of most commonly used descriptors for a built work and to provide for these, in turn, a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. This level of modelling is seen as a necessary basic reference point on which to build more complex documentation. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: </p> <ol> <li> <p>to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams</p> </li> <li> <p>to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data</p> </li> <li> <p>to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns</p> </li> <li> <p>to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"et/built_work/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<p>The decision on which fields to represent was based on a survey of significant, extant data sources of interest to the project.

Such objects, documented on the item level, are typically the physical supports of important documentary evidence in visual, textual or other form, and provide a historical trace or connection to past events as being the unique, individual physical documents created in the life of an individual or institution. Examples of a physical information carrier would include a physical plan, letter or photographic print. The physical information carrier model provides typical fields used for cataloguing information regarding these objects in themselves. The physical information carrier can then be linked to further semantic information records such as the archive unit model for documenting the structural records of an archival recording process or the image model for documenting the intellectual content of a visual image represented on a photographic print.</p>"},{"location":"et/carrier/#names-and-classifications","title":"Names and Classifications","text":"<p>The attribution of names and types is a basic human activity.

A digital object is meant in the sense of a digitally encoded information object represented as bit sequences that have been encoded with a particular format and can be digitally decoded and represented to an end user of a digital information system. Digital objects are often stored as reference or documentation objects relative to cultural heritage items such as textual descriptions stored as PDFs, documentary images, 3D representations and so on. Digital Objects can also form cultural heritage objects in their own right, though this model does not aim to represent this potential aspect of the digital object. Because of the choice to model, the digital object in its role as a secondary documentary resource, the reference data model has been kept as light as possible. This reference model intends to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high-level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for a digital object and to provide for these, in turn, a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: </p> <ol> <li> <p>to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams</p> </li> <li> <p>to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data</p> </li> <li> <p>to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns</p> </li> <li> <p>to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"et/do/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<p>The minimal metadata set for a digital object was abstracted from typical use scenarios in CMS systems related to cultural heritage.</p>"},{"location":"et/do/#model-sections-description","title":"Model Sections Description","text":"<p>The fields used to describe a digital object can be functionally grouped according to higher level units in order to allow for an easier approach to the entry and navigation of the data by information category.

Visual media have the particular characteristic of seriality. The generation of an image is the creation of an intellectual content which thereafter can have multiple manifestations across different potential carriers both analogue and digital. As such the documentation of visual media requires semantic modelling which supports the documentation of both the individual carriers (photographic prints, photographic negatives, slides, catalogued photo material, born digital images etc.) and the image itself as the consistent object carried in various ways across these different media. The image model is meant to support the documentation of the latter. Similar to the concept of \u2018work\u2019 in FRBR and FRBRoo, the image is primary intellectual object created and then manifested in different media over time. The image model enables the representation of this intellectual content as such and linking it, in turn, to its potential carriers: physical information carriers and digital resources.</p>"},{"location":"et/img/#names-and-classifications","title":"Names and Classifications","text":"<p>The attribution of names and types to an image, as with other entities, is a basic human activity.

Place here is interpreted as a geometric extent used for locating entities relative to a reference space. The scope of entities that this reference model aims to cover are places as typically documented in gazetteers. Examples of places would be Edmonton (the inhabited city), Alberta (the administrative district), Canada (the country). The aim of this reference model is to cover basic descriptors that are typically employed in the documentation of a place, usually by a gazetteer. This reference model aims to remain at a general level description, providing a consolidated, high-level reference data model of most commonly reused descriptors for a place as such and to provide for these, in turn, a set of standard semantic mappings to the CIDOC CRM. Moreover, each field is marked with regards to its potential functionality with regards to instance matching between overlapping datasets. This level of modelling is seen as a necessary basic reference point on which to build more complex documentation. This reference data model aims to serve a number of functions including: </p> <ol> <li> <p>to support the creation of semantic data entry forms that will create \u2018born semantic\u2019 data streams</p> </li> <li> <p>to serve as a reference guide in designing eventually compatible data structures for feeding into larger aggregations of Cultural Heritage data</p> </li> <li> <p>to guide mapping processes of extant data sources with common mapping patterns</p> </li> <li> <p>to be adopted by institutions acting as aggregation hubs in order to create consistent re-expressions of extant reference information in a common CIDOC-CRM based expression.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"et/place/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<p>There are many good and well known schema for structuring place data.

A chief factor in disambiguating places lies in understanding the various names and identifiers that have been given to them at different moments in their individual histories. Historical places often receive different names according to the groups naming it, as well as receiving different kinds of names according to contexts and during different historical moments. Likewise, additional classifiers of a place, such as how it is has been formally classified, give important distinguishing characteristics. Because the type of a place is a socially related factor, dependent on how the place is appropriated/used in human interaction, the type of a place may change over time.

This representation allows both for documentation of contemporaneous containment relations but also the expression of a place falling within another place or containing one at a particular historical time.</p> identifier Name Description CRM Path used by place_35_has_part Has Part This field is used to indicate individually documented sub places which form part of the documented place. -&gt;P89i-&gt;E53[35_1] nan place_36_is_part_of Is Part of This field is used to indicate that the broader geographic place that the documented place falls within. -&gt;P89-&gt;E53[36_1] nan place_42_historically_is_part_of_place Historically was Part of Place This field is used to indicate the broader geographic place that the documented place falls within. -&gt;P161i-&gt;E4[42_1]-&gt;P166i-&gt;E93[42_2]-&gt;P10-&gt;E4[42_3]-&gt;P161-&gt;E53[42_4]-&gt;P168-&gt;geo:wkt nan place_45_historically_is_part_of_place_-_earliest_date_time Historically was Part of Place - Earliest Date Time This field is used to indicate the earliest point during which this instance of place fell within the place that it was historically a part of. -&gt;P161i-&gt;E4[42_1]-&gt;P166i-&gt;E93[42_2]-&gt;P160-&gt;E52[45_1]-&gt;P82a-&gt;xsd:dateTime nan place_46_historically_is_part_of_place_-_latest_date_time Historically was Part of Place - Latest Date Time This field is used to indicate the latest point during which this instance of place fell within the place that it was historically a part of.This field is used to indicate the latest point during which this instance of place fell within the place that it was historically a part of. -&gt;P161i-&gt;E4[42_1]-&gt;P166i-&gt;E93[42_2]-&gt;P160-&gt;E52[45_1]-&gt;P82b-&gt;xsd:dateTime nan place_43_name_at_time_of_historically_being_part_of_place Name at Time of Historically Being Part of Place This field is used to indicate the name of the place at the time of containing another historical place. -&gt;P161i-&gt;E4[19]-&gt;P166i-&gt;E93[20]-&gt;P10i-&gt;F52[21]-&gt;R64-&gt;E33_E41[22]-&gt;P190-&gt;rdf:Literal-&gt;P161i-&gt;E4[19]-&gt;P166i-&gt;E93[20]-&gt;P10i-&gt;F52[21]-&gt;P140-&gt;E4[19]-&gt;P161i-&gt;E4[19]-&gt;P166i-&gt;E93[20]-&gt;P164-&gt;E52[25]-&gt;P82a-&gt;xsd:dateTime-&gt;P161i-&gt;E4[19]-&gt;P166i-&gt;E93[20]-&gt;P164-&gt;E52[25]-&gt;P82b-&gt;xsd:dateTime nan place_44_type_at_time_of_historically_being_part_of_place Type at Time of Historically Being Part of Place This field is used to indicate the type of the place at the time of containing another historical place. -&gt;P161i-&gt;E4[19]-&gt;P166i-&gt;E93[20]-&gt;P10i-&gt;E17[23]-&gt;P42-&gt;E55[24]-&gt;P161i-&gt;E4[19]-&gt;P166i-&gt;E93[20]-&gt;P10i-&gt;E17[23]-&gt;P41-&gt;E4[19]-&gt;P161i-&gt;E4[19]-&gt;P166i-&gt;E93[20]-&gt;P164-&gt;E52[25]-&gt;P82a-&gt;xsd:dateTime-&gt;P161i-&gt;E4[19]-&gt;P166i-&gt;E93[20]-&gt;P164-&gt;E52[25]-&gt;P82b-&gt;xsd:dateTime nan place_47_historical_coordinates Historical Coordinates This field is used to indicate the historical coordinates of the geographic place to which the occurrence of the documented instance of place is localized.. -&gt;P161i-&gt;E4[42_1]-&gt;P166i-&gt;E93[42_2]-&gt;P161-&gt;E53[47_1]-&gt;P168-&gt;geo:wkt nan <p></p> Turtle Encoding <pre><code>@prefix crm: &lt;http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/&gt;

Creation through crowdsourcing of an annotated dataset for this task, consisting of ~1k image pairs (crowdsourcing of annotations + manual curation). The annotations platform follows a gamification approach in order to keep contributors/annotators engaged. The dataset is used to train a CNN Siamese network to capture similarity between images, with some resiliency to e.g. age of the pictures (the learned representations are domain-invariant).

When aggregating large amount of data from multiple providers, the chances of having duplicates in the aggregated collection increase, thus requiring ways of performing near duplicate detection, which is one of the applications of image similarity models/tools. The ArtVision platform allows Pharos curators to review and validate the results of automatic duplicate detection (performed using Pastec [REF]). The results returned by the CV models are modelled semantically using a combination of CIDOC-CRM and the Similarity Ontology[^8] and then ingested into a ResearchSpace instance, which supports the curation by domain experts. </p> <p>Bilder der Schweiz Online (BSO)<sup>5</sup> is a joint project between University of Zurich and SARI which aims at supporting research on the historical image of Switzerland by using a collection of images of Switzerland, namely topographical art and photography from the 18<sup>th</sup> to the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. The BSO portal [link] offers a multi-faceted semantic access to this image collection. Among its key features, the portal allows users to search images by places they depict; this is achieved by identifying landscape images with an automatic classifier, trained ad-hoc, and then geo-referencing them by using sMapshot[^6]. Another interesting functionality of this portal is the support for image search by plain text input, a functionality that exploits the capabilities of the multi-modal model CLIP. </p> <p>As a sort of conclusion, highlight the importance of automatic classification, as an intermediate step of more complex pipelines.

This pattern allows for expressing the fact that the similarity of an image pair can be measure by different tools thus leading to different similarity scores. - Modelling of colour-scheme extraction. In the BSO knowledge graph, the extraction of colour-scheme from images is modelled as follows: the Python code (Jupyter notebook) that contains the programming logic for computing the colour-scheme of an image is modelled as a specific technique (<code>crm:E29 Design or Procedure</code>) used by an attribute assignment activity (<code>crm:E13 Attribute Assignment</code>), whose time-span corresponds to the execution time/date of the Jupyter notebook.  - Modelling of geo-referencing of images. In the BSO knowledge graph, images (of paintings) are enriched with geo-referencing information created by using the Smapshot tool. The process of geo-referencing is modelled as an instance of  <code>crmsci:S7 Simulation or Prediction</code> from the Scientific Observation Model (CRMsci)<sup>5</sup>, which in turn is a specialisation of <code>crm:E13 Attribute Assignment</code>.

The semantic encoding of machine-generated annotations put forward by the BSO project at SARI demonstrates the feasibility of employing classes and properties from CIDOC-CRM to this end.
